    <p class="hello-section">
      Hello and welcome! My name is Ben Lee, I'm based in Halifax, Nova Scotia where I also completed my Master's Degree in Computer Science in the field of Graphics.
      <br><br>
      If you look below you'll find some of the projects I have worked on. They can kind of be split into three categories: one is work from my Master's Thesis or other school work. I also included some of the game jams I've submitted to. And you can also take a look at some of the general graphics projects I've been interested in, like my game engine that uses Vulkan and Radiance Cascades, or the slime mold simulation you can run in your browser!
